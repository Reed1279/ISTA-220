1. What is a class? According to the book, what does a class ‚Äùarrange?"

	-Systematically arranges information and behavior into a meaningful entity.
1. What are the two purposes of encapsulation?

	-To combine methods and data within a class. To control the accessibility of the methods and data.
1. How do you instantiate an instance of a class? How do you access that instance?

	-Create a variable specifying the class as its type, and then you initialize the variable with some valid data. 
1. What is the default access of the fields and methods of a class? How do you change the default?

	-Private and inaccessible to code outside the class, but you can use the public keyword to expose fields and methods to the outside world.
1. What is the syntax for writing a constructor?

	-Public method that does not return a value and has the same name as the class. 
1. What is the difference between class fields and methods, and instance fields and methods? How do you create class fields and methods?

	-Class fields and methods provide a useful function that is independent of any specific class instance. If you declare a method or a field as static, you can call the method or access the field by using the name of the class. No instance is required.
1. How do you bring a static class in scope? Why would you want to bring a static class in scope?

	-Static using statements enable you to bring a class into scope and omit the class name when accessing static members. They operate in much the same way as ordinary using statements that bring namespaces into scope. 
1. Can you think of a good reason to create an anonymous class? What is it?

	-Anonymous classes can be useful when using query expressions. An anonymous class does not have a name.
1. What is polymorphism as this term is used in computer science? This is not in the book.

	-The third pillar of object-oriented programming, after encapsulation and inheritance. Polymorphism is a Greek word that means "many-shaped" and it has two distinct aspects:
1. What is message passing as this term is used in computer science? This is not in the book.

	-Message passing sends a message to a process and relies on the process and the supporting infrastructure to select and invoke the actual code to run. 
1. What was the first object-oriented programming language?

	-Simula 67 (1967) was the first programming language.
1. Consider this quote by Alexander Stepanov:

	I find OOP technically unsound. It attempts to decompose the world in terms of interfaces that vary on a single type. To deal with the real problems you need multisorted algebras - families of interfaces that span multiple types. I find OOP philosophically unsound. It claims that everything is an object. Even if it is true it is not very interesting - saying that everything is an object is saying nothing at all.

	Who is Alexander Stephanov?

	-Alexander Stephanov is a Russian computer programmer, best known as an advocate of generic programming and as the primary designer and implementer of the C++ Standard Template Library. He is credited with the notion of concept.
1. What do you think about this quote?

	-I believe there is more meaning within the quote without outright saying so.  I believe he was trying to get people to open their minds and be more dynamic as programers. Call it multi dimesional if you will.  Do you program as if you are looking at a one dimensional object, thus limiting yourself to the probabilities?  Or do you see it as a four dimensional object with multiple directions of applying influence.
