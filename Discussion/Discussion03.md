1. What is a method? 

	-A method is a named sequence of statements.
1. What does a return statement do? 

	-Ends the function call. If you want a method to return information (that is, its return type is not void), you must include a return statement at the end of the processing in the method body. A return statement consists of the keyword return followed by an expression that specifies the returned value and a semicolon.
1. What is an expression bodied method? 

	-The main differences are the use of the => operator to reference the expression that forms the body of the method and the absence of a return statement. The value of the expression is used as the return value; if the expression does not return a value, then the method is void.
1. What is the scope of a variable? 

	-When a variable can be accessed at a particular location in a program, the variable is said to be in scope at that location. To put it another way, the scope of a variable is simply the region of the program in which that variable is usable.
1. What is an overloaded method? 

	-If two identifiers have the same name and are declared in the same scope, they are said to be overloaded. 
1. How do you call a method that requirements arguments? 

	-You provide the arguments in the parenthesis of the method call. You must supply an argument for each parameter, and the value of each argument must be compatible with the type of its corresponding parameter. 
1. How do you write a method, that is, specify the method definition, that requires a parameter list? 

	-You include the parameters in the parenthesis of the method declaration by providing the name of the type followed by the name of the parameter. If the method youâ€™re writing has two or more parameters, you must separate them with commas. 
1. How do you specify a parameter as optional when defining a method? 

	-You specify that a parameter is optional when you define a method by providing a default value for the parameter. You indicate a default value by using the assignment operator.
1. How do you pass an argument to a method as a named parameter? 

	-You specify the name of the parameter, followed by a colon and the value to use.
